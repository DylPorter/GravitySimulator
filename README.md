# GravitySimulator

A simple simulation of orbital mechanics created in C++ using the [raylib](https://www.raylib.com/) library.

Mathematics based on [Newton's law of universal gravitation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newton%27s_law_of_universal_gravitation) and [leapfrog integration](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leapfrog_integration) to apply the calculations.

Idea inspired by my own love for astrophysics, but has already been attempted by many others.
